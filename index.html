                <h2>👋 Hello! I'm <span class="highlight">Prashanth Reddy</span></h2>
                <p>
                    I'm a recent graduate in <b>Electronics and Communication Engineering</b> from Vignana Bharathi Institute of Technology, Hyderabad, with a strong passion for electronics and problem-solving. I’m driven by a deep curiosity and a commitment to innovation, resulting in hands-on projects and internships that have sharpened my skills and broadened my perspectives.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My technical foundation includes <b>Python programming, Digital Electronics, Verilog HDL, and VLSI logic design</b>. I'm skilled in RTL and gate-level simulations, test bench creation, and debugging. Additionally, I've gained experience in <strong>Web Development</strong> (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js) and <strong>Data Analytics</strong> (MongoDB, SQL, MS Excel).
                </p>
                <p>
                    I enjoy working on innovative projects that address real-world problems. One such project, <b>NexaCart</b>, is a sample e-commerce platform for electronics, books, and fashion. Another, the <b>Smart Trolley</b> 🛒, aims to reduce wait times in malls by enabling direct billing at the trolley, bypassing traditional checkouts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    🎯Currently, I'm seeking opportunities to apply my skills in a dynamic organization where I can create impactful solutions and grow professionally. I’m passionate about continuous learning and exploring new technologies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    📌Outside of my professional life, I love to travel, as it provides invaluable experiences, and I enjoy playing cricket in my free time.
                </p>
